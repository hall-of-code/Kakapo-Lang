# Knife Programming Language Concepts
The Knife Programming Language is an Project by myself. The Language isnt developed for know, its planned to build an
Interpreter in V, Go or Rust.

## Comments
Comments in **Knife** are completly ignored by the Compiler/Interpreter. So you can write what ever you want.
```
//this is a single line comment

/*
This is a multiline 
comment!
*/


/*
[Description of a Feature]
This is the best practice example to write readable comments.
*/
```
